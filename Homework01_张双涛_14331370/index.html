			<p><q>Excellent recipe! Nice and lemony, not too sweet with good proportions of curd and meringue. My second attempt on lemon meringue pie. I recommend stirring the curd very frequently to prevent bu...</q></p>
			<p><q>This was a great pie after some tweaking as follows: for the filling I used 1 1/4 cups of extra fine sugar, 3 1/2 tbsps of cornstarch 2 oz of lemon juice 1 1/2 teaspoons of lemon extract and 1 t...</q></p>

			<p><q></q>Absolutely Fabulous.I made this for my anniversary and it was my first attempt at making such a decadent desert. Other reviewers complained about several aspects of this recipe.My fix, increase servings to 12 and use a 9"deep-dish pie crust(you will have more pie filling).Use milk instead of water(if you can).Zest 3 lemons and use 1/2 c. lemon juice(will not be too tart).Prepare all of your ingredients first,as you need to work fast.Lower the temp.when cooking the filling (mine wanted to burn).It took me forever to make the meringue so start in advance(my recommendation would be to use your kitchenaid mixer to save you time) Good luck and enjoy.</p>
